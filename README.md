# Canvas
This is a demo of how to scroll, scale, and rotate stuff on an HTML5 canvas. 

I think I'll probably forget how to do this later, it took me a few hours to figure out a working demo for, so I'm just posting it for my own (or others') reference.

The code is 95% modular, so there's a basic keybinding manager I wrote (keybindmanager.js). Mouse event support as well (mouse.js), again modular. Canvas support, mostly modular (paint.js). Yeah, just look through the code, it's pretty simple.


Edit: on later reflection, if I cut out a bit of useless code, this could be a great game framework for beginners
